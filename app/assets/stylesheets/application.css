/*
 * This is a manifest file thatll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugins
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * Youre free to add application-wide styles to this file and theyll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
